# G2-project-2_ETL_UWADA
Group 2 - ETL project

## Objective
The objective is to perform the ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process by reading the dataset of *The Billboard*, *The Spotify*, cleaning the dataset in the desired form and loading into a database for storage.

## Data Sources
- *The Hot 100* - **Web Scraping** - https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/
- *The Spotify* - **Web api** - https://developer.spotify.com/
- *The Bandsintown* - **Web api** - https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists
## Solution

**We have performed ETL in three steps**:

**_Extraction_**: 
Billboardâ€™s Hot 100 song data scrapped from the website. Further data from the songs extracted from Spotify (for Developers) website through multiple API calls.

**_Transformation_**: 
Python used as the tool for transformation of datasets using the Pandas Library.

**_Loading_**: 
Cleaned data loaded onto relational database PostgreSQL.
